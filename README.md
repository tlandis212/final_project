# Effect of Absentee Voting on Future Electoral Participation

## About

Does the experience of voting for the first time have an effect on future participation in elections? Every year millions of young people cast a ballot for the first time. Many do it at the polls, like most Americans, but many vote using an absentee ballot. In line with previous research on voting and habit formation, we hypothesize that the actual, in-person experience of casting your first ballot (and recieving a sticker, taking a selfie, and potentially celebrating with peers) could be more impactful in terms of habit formation, than the dull process of filling out an absentee ballot. By looking at first-time voters in North Carolina, we will see if voting absentee-by-mail has a negative effect on future participation compared to those who vote in-person.

## Download
Our data can be downloaded from the North Carolina Secretary of State's [website](https://www.ncsbe.gov/Public-Records-Data-Info/Election-Results-Data). The datasets I use are labeled "Current Statewide Voter Registration," "Current Statewide Voter History."

We cleaned, joined, and trimmed these two datasets to create voter_cohort.Rdata, which can be found in this repository.
