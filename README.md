## Download
My data can be downloaded from the North Carolina Secretary of State's [website](https://www.ncsbe.gov/Public-Records-Data-Info/Election-Results-Data). The datasets I use are labeled "Current Statewide Voter Registration," "Current Statewide Voter History," "Alamance Current Voter Registration," and "Alamance Current Voter History."

These datasets are too large to upload to GitHub. I am following the instructions specificed in [this](https://piazza.com/class/k5y1jx0s5ibe1?cid=263) Piazza post.
